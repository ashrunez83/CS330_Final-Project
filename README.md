# CS330_Final-Project
Scene Design
The purpose of this project was to design and implement a complete 3D scene using OpenGL to demonstrate an understanding of core computational graphics concepts. This included transformations, texturing, shaders, and lighting. In my final scene I combined the work completed from all previous milestones which reflected enhancements that were implemented based on assignment feedback.
In my completed scene, I recreated a Mario Bros. inspired environment that consisted of a vibrant grassy ground plane, a brick block, and a golden coin. The project emphasizes a clean structure, modular code design, and appropriate shader usage while maintaining a visually clear and functional scene.
